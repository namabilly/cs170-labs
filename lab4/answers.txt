Part 1:

Exercise 1:
It searches for functions that contain smutex in all files and prints them. 
And then it prints the files that import these files.
./sthread.cpp:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex)
./sthread.cpp:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex)
./sthread.cpp:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex)

Exercise 2:
grep Task RequestGenerator.cpp
grep return *.h

Exercise 3:
./sthread.h:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex);
It prints all function declaration that starts with "smutex".

Exercise 4:
include/linux/blkdev.h

Exercise 5: 
It is a struct. But I got "tag not found error"

Exercise 6: 
There are 3. They are defined in kernel/sched/auto_group.c and kernel/sched/debug.c

Exercise 7: 
find . -name "*.h" | wc
3915
